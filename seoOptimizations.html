    OpenGraph tags
    Is there a reason keywords is only on the juicer-index page and not the home page? 
    Also, why does the main page have the social media meta(og, twitter) and not the juicer-index page? I see that
    the production build or the one you sent us doesn't have these tags but the non production build has these, why?
    Robots meta tags? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JwJvaE9M2Y
    Alt tags should be more descriptive on juicer-index page? No alt tags on images of main page?
    Canonical represents master copy of a page, helps remove problems, I didn't see it in home page or production juicer-index, 
    did you guys mean to include some?
    What Keywords ais omega juicers trying to appeal to? Healthy Living? Immune System? etc.?
